# feed_bot

You can run this simple code in a dedicated server (maybe a VPS you own) to impress your friends or your better half! The idea is simple: use Telegram Bot to send them random nice messages during the day or awesome pictures you took together during the last trip! This is a funny way to keep in contact and let them know you think about them! 

Don't forget to add photo files in the '/pics' directory on the root folder.


Enjoy! :)
